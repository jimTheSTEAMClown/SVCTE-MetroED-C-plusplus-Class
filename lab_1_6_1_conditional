// Now listen to an ancient story that says:
// We need a number that:
// is greater than or equal to zero and less than ten
// or
// its value multiplied by 2 is less than twenty and its value reduced by two is greater than minus two
// or
// its value reduced by one is greater than one and its value divided by 2 is less than ten
// or
// it is equal to 111
// Write the above condition in the form of expression accepted by the C++ language and assign its result to the answer variable.
//

  answer = value; // insert your expression here. See lab description
